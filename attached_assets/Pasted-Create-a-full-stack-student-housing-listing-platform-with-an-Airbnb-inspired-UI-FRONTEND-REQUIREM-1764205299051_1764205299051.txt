Create a full-stack student housing listing platform with an Airbnb-inspired UI. 

FRONTEND REQUIREMENTS:
- Build a React application with the following pages:
  1. Home/Search page with filters (location, price range, bedrooms, move-in date)
  2. Detailed listing page matching Airbnb's design aesthetic
  3. User authentication (sign up/login)
  4. Host dashboard to manage listings
  
- For the listing detail page, include:
  * Full-width image gallery with thumbnail navigation
  * Sticky booking card with pricing breakdown
  * Key features grid (bedrooms, bathrooms, area, availability)
  * Amenities section with icons
  * Reviews with ratings and user avatars
  * Interactive map showing approximate location
  * Host profile with response time and rating
  * Security deposit and total cost calculator
  
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Make it fully responsive (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Add smooth animations and hover effects
- Use Lucide React or React Icons for icons

BACKEND REQUIREMENTS:
- Set up Node.js/Express server with PostgreSQL database
- Create the following database tables:
  * users (students and landlords)
  * listings (properties)
  * reviews
  * bookings
  * amenities
  * images
  
- Implement REST API endpoints:
  * GET /api/listings - fetch all listings with filters
  * GET /api/listings/:id - fetch single listing details
  * POST /api/listings - create new listing (landlord only)
  * PUT /api/listings/:id - update listing
  * DELETE /api/listings/:id - delete listing
  * POST /api/reviews - submit review
  * GET /api/reviews/:listingId - fetch reviews for a listing
  * POST /api/bookings - create booking request
  * Authentication endpoints (register, login, logout)

- Add authentication using JWT tokens
- Implement image upload with Cloudinary or similar service

ADDITIONAL FEATURES:

- Favorites/wishlist system
- Messaging system between students and landlords
- Email notifications for bookings and messages
- Price comparison showing savings

- Student-specific features (university proximity, academic calendar lease terms)

SAMPLE DATA:
Include 5-10 sample listings near major universities (NYU, Columbia, Boston University) with realistic data including:
- Multiple high-quality images per listing
- Detailed descriptions
- Various price points ($1500-$6000/month)
- Different property types (studio, 1BR, 2BR, 3BR)
- Mix of reviews (4-5 star ratings)

Start with the frontend listing detail page first, then build the backend API, then connect them together. Use modern best practices and make the code production-ready.
